I know you just wanted the best for me; at least, the best that I could have as a woman. There was always a subtle conflict between the church message that women should be submissive wives and mothers and what you told me - that I could do anything. That I was intelligent and capable. That I was strong. There was always a subtle conflict between those messages you tried to instill in me and the reality of how you treated me — as weak for having emotions. As your property to give away to my future husband for having a vagina.  ",

I thought that expending emotional energy on every person who entered my life was just the way it had to be. So this past week, I exercised my new understanding of this topic to lay down some pretty intense boundaries with someone who definitely deserved all the snark that came along with it.  I recently received a message from someone I knew in college; I’ll call her Bekah. We played sports together, but were never very close. I wasn’t very close to many people, actually, because it’s hard to get close to people at a conservative Baptist college when you are secretly deconstructing your entire belief system.  Anyway, I haven’t spoken to Bekah in almost 3 years, but she just couldn’t help herself. She sent me a message about the fact that I came out as bisexual, &amp;amp; I felt compelled to respond. Jared helped me write the message (&amp;amp; he also made me take out all the big bad swears *pouty face*). Below is the text of our messages.  ",

And that queerness, and my growing understanding and acceptance of it, is who I am.  Being queer doesn’t make my life any less a testament to the glory of God or the work of God’s spirit in my life or make me less wholly, entirely Jesus Christ’s.  The more queer I am, the more Christian I am.” [1]  ",

I can tolerate it and even get into the spirit for the week leading up to Christmas, but other than that, I can’t stand listening to it. Of course, when I was young, I looked forward to opening gifts and spending time out of school. We always visited my grandparents, and there was often snow on the ground for sledding. I have generally happy memories associated with Christmas.  And yet, I find myself increasingly dreading the holiday.  I don’t think it has much to do with Christmas, honestly. What isn’t there to love about a consumerist holiday veiled as religious celebration? It probably has a lot more to do with traditions and a culture surrounding it that feel more and more foreign to me as I distance myself from my upbringing.  ",
