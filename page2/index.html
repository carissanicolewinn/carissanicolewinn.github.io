        <p><strong><em>*** CAPTAIN MARVEL SPOILERS ***</em></strong><br /><br />I’m not much of a superhero person; in fact, I’m not much of a <em>movie person</em> in general. This week, however, I watched Captain Marvel and found myself moved to tears.<br /><br />Carol’s journey resonates deeply in my body because our paths have been all too similar.<br /><br /><br /> <a href="/not-saying-captain-marvel/"><img src="/images/post-headers/captain-marvel.png" alt="graphic displaying the title of the article" /></a></p>

        <p>Bi+ erasure and invisibility often make me feel like my bisexuality doesn’t actually exist unless I’m walking around holding hands with my obviously cis male partner and kissing an obviously cis woman at the same time while wearing a shirt that says “I’M BISEXUAL!” in all caps. <br /><br /> <a href="/ways-i-honor-my-bisexuality/"><img src="/images/post-headers/honor-my-bisexuality.png" alt="graphic displaying the title of the article" /></a></p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>In every sermon and Sunday School lesson about Genesis 3, Eve was always the antagonist of the story. She was the one who disobeyed God, who communicated with the serpent, and who convinced Adam to eat the forbidden fruit. She’s the reason shame befell the human race and the reason God kicked them both out of the garden. <br /><br /> But what if Eve wasn’t the bad guy, so to speak? <br /><br /> What happens if we come back to this text with fresh eyes and a different hermeneutic? <br /><br /> <a href="/queering-eve/"><img src="/images/post-headers/queering-eve.png" alt="graphic displaying the title of the article" /></a></p>

      <h1><a href="/bekah-learns-boundaries/">Bekah Learns Boundaries</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>The concept of setting boundaries is still relatively new to me. I didn’t know until recently that it is acceptable &amp; normal to put boundaries on relationships. I thought that expending emotional energy on every person who entered my life was just the way it had to be. So this past week, I exercised my new understanding of this topic to lay down some pretty intense boundaries with someone who definitely deserved all the snark that came along with it. <br /><br /> I recently received a message from someone I knew in college; I’ll call her Bekah. We played sports together, but were never very close. I wasn’t very close to many people, actually, because it’s hard to get close to people at a conservative Baptist college when you are secretly deconstructing your entire belief system. <br /><br /> Anyway, I haven’t spoken to Bekah in almost 3 years, but she just couldn’t help herself. She sent me a message about the fact that I came out as bisexual, &amp; I felt compelled to respond. Jared helped me write the message (&amp; he also made me take out all the <em>big bad swears</em> *pouty face*). Below is the text of our messages. <br /><br /> <a href="/bekah-learns-boundaries/"><img src="/images/post-headers/bekah-learns-boundaries.png" alt="graphic displaying the title of the article" /></a></p>

        <p>“I never became more queer. I can’t become less queer. But my awareness of myself – my falling-in-love, non-discriminatory silly starry-eyed self that falls in love with people whose funny, gentle, kind, fierce souls shine out through their eyes whether they’re men or women – that queerness is a thing that I have discovered over time. And that queerness, and my growing understanding and acceptance of it, is who I am. <br /><br /> Being queer doesn’t make my life any less a testament to the glory of God or the work of God’s spirit in my life or make me less wholly, entirely Jesus Christ’s. <br /><br /> The more queer I am, the more Christian I am.” [1] <br /><br /> <a href="/coming-out/"><img src="/images/post-headers/coming-out/nosering.jpg" alt="selfie of me wearing glasses &amp; showing off my new nose ring" /></a></p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>I have always been a bit of a Scrooge at Christmastime, especially when it comes to Christmas music. I can tolerate it and even get into the spirit for the week leading up to Christmas, but other than that, I can’t stand listening to it. Of course, when I was young, I looked forward to opening gifts and spending time out of school. We always visited my grandparents, and there was often snow on the ground for sledding. I have generally happy memories associated with Christmas. <br /><br /> And yet, I find myself increasingly dreading the holiday. <br /><br /> I don’t think it has much to do with Christmas, honestly. What isn’t there to love about a consumerist holiday veiled as religious celebration? It probably has a lot more to do with traditions and a culture surrounding it that feel more and more foreign to me as I distance myself from my upbringing. <br /><br /> <a href="/dreading-christmas/"><img src="/images/post-headers/dreading-christmas.png" alt="graphic displaying the title of the article" /></a></p>

I couldn’t get it to load on my phone at the moment, so I moved on and forgot about it (much like the instances discussed in the article itself, ironically). <br /><br /> Today, it popped up again, this time shared by a friend with her own personal stories of male harrassment and living in a patriarchal, sexist culture attached to it. I was inspired, probably impulsively, to write up a small collection of my own stories. There are plenty more that I could tell, but these are the few that stuck out to me. <br /><br /> <a href="/on-being-a-woman/"><img src="/images/post-headers/on-being-a-woman.png" alt="graphic displaying the title of the article" /></a></p>
