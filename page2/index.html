      <h1><a href="/Bekah-Learns-Boundaries/">Bekah Learns Boundaries</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>The concept of setting boundaries is still relatively new to me. I didn’t know until recently that it is acceptable &amp; normal to put boundaries on relationships. I thought that expending emotional energy on every person who entered my life was just the way it had to be. So this past week, I exercised my new understanding of this topic to lay down some pretty intense boundaries with someone who definitely deserved all the snark that came along with it. <br /><br /> I recently received a message from someone I knew in college; I’ll call her Bekah. We played sports together, but were never very close. I wasn’t very close to many people, actually, because it’s hard to get close to people at a conservative Baptist college when you are secretly deconstructing your entire belief system. <br /><br /> Anyway, I haven’t spoken to Bekah in almost 3 years, but she just couldn’t help herself. She sent me a message about the fact that I came out as bisexual, &amp; I felt compelled to respond. Jared helped me write the message (&amp; he also made me take out all the <em>big bad swears</em> *pouty face*). Below is the text of our messages. <br /><br /> <img src="/images/post-headers/bekah-learns-boundaries.png" alt="graphic displaying the title of the article" /></p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>“I never became more queer. I can’t become less queer. But my awareness of myself – my falling-in-love, non-discriminatory silly starry-eyed self that falls in love with people whose funny, gentle, kind, fierce souls shine out through their eyes whether they’re men or women – that queerness is a thing that I have discovered over time. And that queerness, and my growing understanding and acceptance of it, is who I am. <br /><br /> Being queer doesn’t make my life any less a testament to the glory of God or the work of God’s spirit in my life or make me less wholly, entirely Jesus Christ’s. <br /><br /> The more queer I am, the more Christian I am.” [1] <br /><br /> <img src="/images/coming-out/nosering.jpg" alt="selfie of me wearing glasses &amp; showing off my new nose ring" /></p>

      <h1><a href="/Christmas/">Dreading Christmas</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>I have always been a bit of a Scrooge at Christmastime, especially when it comes to Christmas music. I can tolerate it and even get into the spirit for the week leading up to Christmas, but other than that, I can’t stand listening to it. Of course, when I was young, I looked forward to opening gifts and spending time out of school. We always visited my grandparents, and there was often snow on the ground for sledding. I have generally happy memories associated with Christmas. <br /><br /> And yet, I find myself increasingly dreading the holiday. <br /><br /> I don’t think it has much to do with Christmas, honestly. What isn’t there to love about a consumerist holiday veiled as religious celebration? It probably has a lot more to do with traditions and a culture surrounding it that feel more and more foreign to me as I distance myself from my upbringing. <br /><br /> <img src="/images/post-headers/dreading-christmas.png" alt="graphic displaying the title of the article" /></p>

        <p>I do a lot of reading, specifically blogs, news articles, editorials, etc. Most of what I read I get from my Facebook feed. I was scrolling a few days ago and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gretchen-kelly/the-thing-all-women-do-you-dont-know-about_b_8630416.html?ncid=engmodushpmg00000003" target="_blank">this article</a> caught my eye. I couldn’t get it to load on my phone at the moment, so I moved on and forgot about it (much like the instances discussed in the article itself, ironically). <br /><br /> Today, it popped up again, this time shared by a friend with her own personal stories of male harrassment and living in a patriarchal, sexist culture attached to it. I was inspired, probably impulsively, to write up a small collection of my own stories. There are plenty more that I could tell, but these are the few that stuck out to me. <br /><br /> <img src="/images/post-headers/on-being-a-woman.png" alt="graphic displaying the title of the article" /></p>
