I didn’t know until recently that it is acceptable &amp;amp; normal to put boundaries on relationships. I thought that expending emotional energy on every person who entered my life was just the way it had to be. So this past week, I exercised my new understanding of this topic to lay down some pretty intense boundaries with someone who definitely deserved all the snark that came along with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently received a message from someone I knew in college; I’ll call her Bekah. We played sports together, but were never very close. I wasn’t very close to many people, actually, because it’s hard to get close to people at a conservative Baptist college when you are secretly deconstructing your entire belief system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I haven’t spoken to Bekah in almost 3 years, but she just couldn’t help herself. She sent me a message about the fact that I came out as bisexual, &amp;amp; I felt compelled to respond. Jared helped me write the message (&amp;amp; he also made me take out all the &lt;em&gt;big bad swears&lt;/em&gt; *pouty face*). Below is the text of our messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post-headers/bekah-learns-boundaries.png&quot; alt=&quot;graphic displaying the title of the article&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dear Carissa,
I read the status you posted about a week ago. First, I would like to apologize for not writing this sooner. There have been many hours spent in thought over how to go about this message, so I pray that my speech and motivation is understood. Carissa, something that has honestly really been bothering me about what you posted is that you call yourself more of a Christian for being bisexual. Here is my problem with that, no where does it say that in God’s word. In fact, it says the opposite of that, which is why I am writing to you now. I am truly and deeply concerned about you and the path you are on. My concern stems from the fact that God calls what you are doing sin. I was looking through the Bible for verses on this exact topic and came to find it called nothing but sin. Please understand, I can only claim it as sin because that is what God’s word says. In Romans 1:21-32, it says, “For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Claiming to be wise, they became fools, 23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.
24 Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, 25 because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.
26 For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; 27 and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.
28 And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. 29 They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, 30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, 31 foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. 32 Though they know God’s righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.” This passage clearly shows that God sees homosexuality and bisexuality as a dishonorable passion, something that should not be done, and deserving of death. So you see, if I were to celebrate what you are doing then I would be giving approval to something that I know God says is wrong. By doing so, I would not be acting lovingly toward you, but hating you. It is not an act of love to watch and even encourage someone to continue living in sin, allowing them to get deeper and more attached to it. That is why I apologized at the beginning of this letter. I have allowed a week to go by without confronting you and trying to help you with this temptation. Do not think I have written this letter to make fun of or scorn you. I wrote this because I care about you and am extremely worried that you are headed down a path that leads to judgment. I do not want that for you! A few years ago, you encouraged me in my time of need. I am sorry I have not been there for you in the same way. There are more verses I found on this topic and would be happy to send your way if you would so desire. Carissa, I am praying for you and I hope to speak to you soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dear Bekah,
I wanted to write back to let you know that your motivation was understood perfectly. Let me explain. We haven’t been friends for a while now. In fact, we haven’t even been social media friends, not even “facebook friends” for what little that even means. You are not &amp;amp; have not been involved in my life for several years. And based on that fact, what would make you think that you have the right, the relationship, or the position to write a message like this to me? Isn’t “building a relationship” supposed to be the first step in speaking into someone’s life? Why in the world would you think that you have any authority or reason to say any of this? You know absolutely nothing about me. And honestly, you don’t really want to. You didn’t care about my life before I came out and you don’t care now, you only feel a personal responsibility to tell me these things because of your own conviction. That’s why your motivation is selfish. You didn’t write this message actually thinking that it would have any effect on me. You wrote it for YOU. You were so bothered by my coming out post that you needed to clear your own conscience and be able to say “I did what I could” as if it was your responsibility, in the process ladening me with the same generic cookie-cutter thought process that I’ve been around my entire life. Don’t insult me by pretending I haven’t heard it all before. I understand that in your mind the logic is so airtight that you think “if Carissa believes otherwise, it must be because she forgot”. But that isn’t how this works. I did not forget, the logic is not airtight, and wasting your time writing out all the talking points you should be well aware I learned at the same school as you is just a product of the very dangerous presumption that your theology is undeniably correct to the letter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a small helpful hint for the next time you feel like writing a “convicting” message to someone you haven’t seen or spoken to in YEARS &amp;amp; who you weren’t even that close to in the first place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your motives are not subtle and I promise people can and will continue to see right through them. Approaching topics like this from a holier-than-thou, “I possess knowledge that you don’t” standpoint is only going to alienate others, not convince them. If you believe your purpose as a Christian is to evangelize non-believers (which I am not, for the record), this is the opposite of how to achieve it. No reasonable person would actually believe that a message like this would have any impact on me or my life decisions. Why did you think it would mean something to me? You didn’t. It was for you to be able to say you did it. Why do you think I even care what you think or how YOU interpret the Bible? You can’t claim a monopoly on “Biblical truth” and tote it as the clear and obvious interpretation when the Evangelical church can’t even agree within itself on what is “clear”, let alone the whole of Christianity across the world. Don’t talk to me about “what God says” and expect that to have weight when Christians can’t even agree what God says. Ironically I probably know what you believe about this better than you do, because I put in the work studying it &amp;amp; deciding that it was wrong. I would be willing to bet money that you’ve never given serious, genuine study to the topic of LGBTQ+ “issues”. You just believed what you were taught. I have read hundreds of books &amp;amp; articles, watched lectures, done word studies. Meanwhile you cherry pick a handful of verses, the meaning of which someone else told you and you never gave it a second thought. Your certainty comes from a lifetime of conditioning and insulation from outside thought, not the strength of your belief itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope writing this made you feel better, because you wrote it out of a selfish &amp;amp; condescending desire to fix me. I imagine you also wrote it out of disgust, because I know that you once said you would quit cross country if you found out there was a gay person on the team. Well surprise, I was there the whole time. Luckily I didn’t have to tolerate your homophobia as badly as the other LGBTQ+ people surrounding you. Your interpretation of Scripture leads to the suicides &amp;amp; deaths of hundreds of LGBTQ+ people every year. There are many studies showing this. No good tree bears bad fruit. Your theology bears bad fruit. Period. I don’t have any fanciful ideas that I can change your mind on this, because if you’re the kind of abrasively dogmatic person who writes a message like this to someone you barely know, I can only imagine the kind of damage you would do to an LGBTQ+ person who has the misfortune of knowing you in real life. I want it to be very clear that I know you haven’t studied this, &amp;amp; I want it to be very clear that I actually have. I don’t need you to send me more Bible verses on the topic. I know &amp;amp; could quote to you all 7 “clobber passages”, &amp;amp; I could exegete each one &amp;amp; tell you why I don’t believe they say the things you are claiming. Your conservative white American English Bible is not “clear” on much of anything, &amp;amp; I’m tired of people like you trying to weaponize it against me. I don’t want your prayers. I’m not experiencing temptation. &amp;amp; I most certainly don’t want your homophobic “help” with this. Abandon your pretentious “love” &amp;amp; condescending “apologies”; they will only do people harm.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="christianity" /><category term="lgbtq+" /><category term="personal" /><summary type="html">The concept of setting boundaries is still relatively new to me.

I can’t become less queer. But my awareness of myself – my falling-in-love, non-discriminatory silly starry-eyed self that falls in love with people whose funny, gentle, kind, fierce souls shine out through their eyes whether they’re men or women – that queerness is a thing that I have discovered over time. And that queerness, and my growing understanding and acceptance of it, is who I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being queer doesn’t make my life any less a testament to the glory of God or the work of God’s spirit in my life or make me less wholly, entirely Jesus Christ’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more queer I am, the more Christian I am.” [1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/coming-out/nosering.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;selfie of me wearing glasses &amp;amp; showing off my new nose ring&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I am publicly acknowledging something about myself that I have known for a while - I’m bisexual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I call myself bisexual because I acknowledge that I have in myself the potential to be attracted –– romantically and/or sexually –– to people of more than one sex and/or gender, not necessarily at the same time, not necessarily in the same way, and not necessarily to the same degree.” [2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/coming-out/noseringmeme.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tweet that says &amp;quot;are bisexuals born with nose rings or is it in our agenda&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, this announcement doesn’t change much. I’m still happily married to a man I love deeply, &amp;amp; I accepted that &lt;em&gt;other people&lt;/em&gt; could be LGBTQ+ Christians well before I accepted that I, too, was part of that group. I haven’t had to make any huge theological shifts, I just had to accept that this part of me has always existed &amp;amp; will always exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why bother coming out? Why bother telling the world that I’m bi? Several reasons, actually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be fully known. I don’t want to worry about accidentally outing myself. I want to be able to acknowledge the fact that I have had crushes on celebrities of all genders. I don’t want to hide myself because I’m afraid of the opinions and theology I was raised on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more than those personal things, I want to be visible. I want my life to be part of a conversation that is so very important &amp;amp; so very absent from many of the spaces I grew up in. LGBTQ+ folks exist even in those places where they are most condemned, but hiding from yourself &amp;amp; others always leads to pain &amp;amp; trauma. I also want to be visible because there are lots of misconceptions &amp;amp; stereotypes about bi+ people. A big part of tearing down those ideas is living visibly as a bi woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here are a few answers to frequently asked questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jared supports &amp;amp; loves me &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of who I am, not in spite of it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;my marriage is doing great&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am no less capable of commitment in relationships because of my bisexuality&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am no more sexual or “promiscuous” than anyone else because of my bisexuality&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in answer to any questions about my sex life, who I have or haven’t kissed in my life, etc.- that’s very weird to ask, please stop &amp;amp; reevaluate why you care&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/coming-out/gaystreet.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture of me holding a bi pride flag in front of a street sign that reads &amp;quot;Gay Street&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I want to thank those people who have become my closest friends &amp;amp; support system, even if you’re “just an internet friend.” You know who you are.&lt;/p&gt;

I can tolerate it and even get into the spirit for the week leading up to Christmas, but other than that, I can’t stand listening to it. Of course, when I was young, I looked forward to opening gifts and spending time out of school. We always visited my grandparents, and there was often snow on the ground for sledding. I have generally happy memories associated with Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, I find myself increasingly dreading the holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it has much to do with Christmas, honestly. What isn’t there to love about a consumerist holiday veiled as religious celebration? It probably has a lot more to do with traditions and a culture surrounding it that feel more and more foreign to me as I distance myself from my upbringing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post-headers/dreading-christmas.png&quot; alt=&quot;graphic displaying the title of the article&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;minefields&quot;&gt;Minefields&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christmas is all about family getting together. Unfortunately, as I have become progressive in my faith and liberal in my politics over the last year and a half, those gatherings are no longer as enjoyable as they once were. I dread the moment one of my family members makes a racist comment or disparages Muslims. It isn’t a question of &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; they will, but &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; they will, and each instance is an internal battle. &lt;em&gt;Is this the right moment to speak up? Am I truly an ally if I let it slide?&lt;/em&gt; I haven’t fully worked out how to choose my battles wisely, and walking into a family gathering full of conservative Evangelical Trump supporters is a minefield. It feels like the onus is on me to keep the peace by staying silent, but while this year has emboldened racists, homophobes, and bigots all across the country, it has also emboldened &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; to speak the truth, even if my voice shakes. I admittedly &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; like to argue, but since I get it from my dad, it’s a recipe for disaster – conflict just waiting to happen. I also know that it doesn’t really matter &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; I say or &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I say it, the conversation is not going to be productive, as no one involved is there with an open mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;swapping-40&quot;&gt;Swapping $40&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have come to despise obligatory gift-giving, and there is nothing quite as obligatory as swapping an arbitrary amount of money with a member of your family simply because you are related. It could be in the form of gift cards, cash, or an actual gift, but let’s be real – there was a set price limit, and all you accomplished was swapping that amount of money. Personally, I would rather keep my $40 and spend it on something I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want, rather than crossing my fingers that the other person will figure it out. My husband’s family attempts to mitigate that fear by simply telling each other exactly what to buy, but that negates the fun of giving a gift in the first place! If I wanted or needed that item so badly, I would have simply bought it with my own $40 instead of telling you to buy it, making you buy gift bags or wrapping paper, and then trying to act surprised when I open it on Christmas. Also, if you come from a family that &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; set price limits, navigating obligatory gift-giving can become even trickier. &lt;em&gt;How much should I spend on their gift? What if they spend a lot more than I spend? Will I look bad? Does it matter?&lt;/em&gt; The real problem is the fact that you are obligated to give them a gift in the first place; if you weren’t required to do so, any gift given would be sincere and it wouldn’t matter how much either of you spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-war-on-christmas&quot;&gt;The War on Christmas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am weary of trying to determine if someone’s &lt;em&gt;“Merry Christmas!”&lt;/em&gt; is sincere or if it’s a subtle &lt;em&gt;“screw you!”&lt;/em&gt; A holiday greeting should not be a weapon of communication intended to let all around you know how “Christian” you are. I am tired of hearing people discuss “how to keep Christ in Christmas” or “the reason for the season”. Cursory research shows that not only was Jesus not born anywhere close to December 25, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.history.com/topics/christmas/history-of-christmas&quot; title=&quot;History of Christmas&quot;&gt;the day of celebration was arbitrarily chosen by Pope Julius I, likely to correspond with the pagan holiday Saturnalia&lt;/a&gt;. The real “reason for the season” is probably a winter solstice festival. On top of all that, the consumerism that runs rampant around Christmastime is given top priority, even in most conservative families such as mine. Sure, we read the Christmas story from Luke before we open gifts, but it isn’t something to be celebrated – it’s merely an inconvenient tradition that stands in the way of the presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;snow-slush-and-cold&quot;&gt;Snow, Slush, and Cold&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reason is definitely the most trite of everything I’ve said, but it still stands – I hate the cold. Snow can be pretty, but it comes at the price of chills and wet feet. Slush is perhaps the worst, as it is cold, wet, and also disgusting. The pros do not outweigh the cons for me, and while I know these things aren’t relegated to &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; Christmastime, that’s the time people generally wish for snow. But I don’t need a white Christmas; unless, of course, we’re talking about white sand beaches in the Caribbean somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="christianity" /><category term="family" /><summary type="html">I have always been a bit of a Scrooge at Christmastime, especially when it comes to Christmas music.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post-headers/the-moment-your-opinion-no-longer-mattered.png&quot; alt=&quot;graphic displaying the title of the article&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was recently married and along with that, recently freed to share my rapidly changing opinions. I was no longer held back by the idea that you might not pay for my schooling or the wedding, so I started sharing “controversial” things on my Facebook page. Refugees have obviously been a hot topic the last few years, and for some reason most of the Christians I grew up around were (and still are) adamantly against taking them in - especially ones from majority Muslim countries. (I know, I know, Sharia law and terrorists and such mean we don’t need to love them. You don’t need to explain yourself to me. *eye roll*)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following tweet from Donald Trump, Jr., was making the rounds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/trumpjrskittles.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot of Trump, Jr.'s skittles tweet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, I shared the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/eattheskittles.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot of &amp;quot;eat the skittles&amp;quot; post&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post caused quite a bit of drama as well as some good, productive conversation. What sticks out to me the most when I think back to it, however, is not the fact that some of my family and friends are seemingly heartless when dealing with Muslims in particular. It’s the response that my father posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father, who spent a lot of time and money sending me to a private Christian academy, taking me to church, making sure I went to youth group, and paying for me to attend a Baptist college. It’s obvious which values he wanted to instill in me, and I would say that by all possible measures, he succeeded. The problem we’ve now run into is that I seem to have bought into a more radical living out of those values than he ever intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Your suggestion with this piece sounds good in theory, and is biblically a good response. But in real life, I guarantee you would think twice and maybe never eat the skittles. Your overt denunciation for the preservation of our ability to even remain the country God has given to us is starting to wear on me. Simply because we want to preserve our God given rights in this country does not mean we have no compassion what so ever for those in need. Your idealistic thoughts are noble, but naive to the world as it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you catch that? Let me make it more obvious, without all the stuff in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Your suggestion with this piece sounds good in theory, and is biblically a good response. But in real life… Your idealistic thoughts are noble, but naive to the world as it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what you’re telling me, dad, is that I have presented a biblically good response that you deem idealistic, naive, and therefore unrealistic to actually live out? Do you hear yourself? Everything you’ve ever presented to me as the truth is centered around the Bible, and now you’re telling me that I got it correct biblically but not “realistically?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My opinions have surely been drifting further and further from yours, but not because I’m leaving the things you taught me behind. I’ve been walking away from your brand of Christianity because I see such a disconnect between the things you told me were true and the things you seem to believe. I’ll cover more of them in future posts, but this particular instance represents the first time the full weight of this discrepancy hit me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You made it blatantly obvious in your comment that you are willing to disregard biblical truths for your own comfort and personal safety. You also apparently place more value on your American rights than you do on biblical truths that might warrant forsaking those rights (but that’s a topic that deserves its own post, as I have since discovered many other areas of your life that such a view affects).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, though, it wasn’t what you said as much as what it represented. Up to the point that this interaction occurred, I still believed that you were just misguided in a few areas, but that you still believed the things you had taught me. I no longer think that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see now that your religion actually has very little to do with following Jesus and much more to do with serving your selfish American ideals. I don’t know where along the line you lost Jesus, or if you never truly wanted to follow him in the first place, but you also lost me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You lost my respect that day, because you didn’t even attempt to use the Bible to back your beliefs. At least people who use the Bible to back up their lack of love can semi-convincingly state that they’re still following the Bible. At least then we can debate biblical interpretation and practical application. You didn’t even try. You just outright ignored the Bible, cast it to the side, instead choosing to follow your nationalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your opinions about my faith and how it should inform my politics no longer matter to me, because you have demonstrated that they are not informed by the love of Jesus but by your love of self and country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite the disappointment I felt upon having this realization, I will continue to love radically, just like you taught me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="christianity" /><category term="family" /><summary type="html">On September 22, 2016, almost exactly a year ago, any weight your opinions may have held in my life vanished.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">On Being a Woman</title><link href="http://carissanicolewinn.github.io/On-Being-a-Woman/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On Being a Woman" /><published>2017-09-12T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-09-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://carissanicolewinn.github.io/On-Being-a-Woman</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://carissanicolewinn.github.io/On-Being-a-Woman/">&lt;p&gt;I do a lot of reading, specifically blogs, news articles, editorials, etc. Most of what I read I get from my Facebook feed. I was scrolling a few days ago and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gretchen-kelly/the-thing-all-women-do-you-dont-know-about_b_8630416.html?ncid=engmodushpmg00000003&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; caught my eye. I couldn’t get it to load on my phone at the moment, so I moved on and forgot about it (much like the instances discussed in the article itself, ironically).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, it popped up again, this time shared by a friend with her own personal stories of male harrassment and living in a patriarchal, sexist culture attached to it. I was inspired, probably impulsively, to write up a small collection of my own stories. There are plenty more that I could tell, but these are the few that stuck out to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;true-stories-from-my-own-life&quot;&gt;True stories from my own life:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was on a work trip, unloading boxes from the truck by the street, &amp;amp; Jared was inside the building &amp;amp; not around, &amp;amp; 2 men were walking by on the sidewalk. One of them very loudly says “HEY BEAUTIFUL,” but I ignore it. Don’t make eye contact. Keep unloading boxes. A few seconds later, when it’s clear I’m not going to interact with his catcalling, he says, very loudly again, “WHAT A BITCH!” &amp;amp; suddenly I’m afraid that he might walk over to me, &amp;amp; I’m all alone, praying that Jared comes back soon. Thankfully, he keeps walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I’m fresh out of high school working at Bob Evans as a waitress the summer before college. The customer base is significantly made up of the elderly, but that doesn’t stop old men from grabbing my hands, telling me that I have a nice “figure,” &amp;amp; leaving me one or two quarters as a tip if I don’t smile, laugh, &amp;amp; flirt back. So I quickly learn that to make money at this job, I have to flirt with the men I serve. Like the table of 4 college aged guys that I had to serve once. Everything they asked for was a sexual innuendo, with their eyes following my chest or my butt as I would walk away to get it for them. I giggled &amp;amp; did my best to play it up, knowing that I’d get a nice tip if I did. &amp;amp; I was right, they left me almost a 75% tip on their meal. My manager (also a man) saw my big tip &amp;amp; promptly walked over to me, bent down, &amp;amp; brushed off my knees as if there was dirt on them. The implication being that I was on my knees giving them sexual favors for such a big tip. The whole kitchen laughed, except for one other waitress who made eye contact with me as I blushed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was still working at that restaurant 2 summers later, &amp;amp; I’m the closing shift. The manager on duty has to walk me to my car, because a man has been hanging around the building trying to talk to the servers as they leave. By the time I’m leaving, it’s dark out, &amp;amp; I have to park by the dumpster where there’s no lamp light because you always save the best parking spots for customers. But once, my manager doesn’t walk me out, &amp;amp; I clutch my keys between my fingers, goosebumps on my arms even though it’s summertime. Thankfully, the creep wasn’t around that night, but who knows what would have happened if he had been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was working at Sears one summer, &amp;amp; a coworker kept getting too close to me physically &amp;amp; trying to flirt with me. My manager informed me that “he’s just like that” so I shouldn’t “let it bother me.” He was uncomfortably close one too many times, &amp;amp; I actually asked him to stop (not told, asked. I wasn’t even mean). He then got angry with me, &amp;amp; since I was the new employee, he successfully convinced a large portion of my coworkers that I was a stuck up bitch. It took me weeks (over 3/4 of the summer) to find more than 1 person who would willingly eat lunch with me because of it, although I did successfully re-convince most of them that I was a nice person by the end of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;minimizing-suppressing-ignoring-denying&quot;&gt;Minimizing, Suppressing, Ignoring, Denying&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gretchen-kelly/the-thing-all-women-do-you-dont-know-about_b_8630416.html?ncid=engmodushpmg00000003&quot;&gt;The Thing All Women Do That You Don’t Know About&lt;/a&gt; does a great job of describing the small incidents that quickly add up in daily life. The glances at our chests, the demeaning nicknames, the way men will stand just slightly too close. Pieces of the bigger picture, one that is hard to recognize even as a woman who lives it. Looking back on most of my stories, I didn’t know that those instances were anything other than normal. I grew up in a culture that taught me to ignore “those” type of men, because their actions were expected. But now, I know that my body is not something to which men are entitled. I know that my time, my feelings, and my affection are not something I must give to anyone who demands it. I know that it is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; normal to constantly put my guard up when interacting with men, whether at work or just walking down the street. But I also know that it is difficult to recognize when you are so entrenched in the system, and almost impossible if you are outside of it. I must learn to stop minimizing, suppressing, ignoring, and/or denying these so-called “small” instances and instead, start exposing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll leave you with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/TheAmyCourts/posts/10155136279258353?pnref=story&quot;&gt;these words&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This line we women dance - of defending ourselves and our right to exist, protecting ourselves from men who feel entitled to our bodies and our conversation, while avoiding angering them and endangering ourselves further - is a daily thing. We can’t go to the store, go for a walk, or go to work without encountering this kind of behavior on the regular.
It is exhausting. 
It’s dehumanizing. 
It’s being a woman.&lt;/p&gt;
