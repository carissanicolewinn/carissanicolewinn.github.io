Well, that’s not entirely true. My entire life has been based around white American conservative Christian values, with much more emphasis on the “white American conservative” part than the “Christian” part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are a few of the lessons you taught me through your words and actions – and they directly contradict what Jesus lived and taught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-giving-to-the-poor&quot;&gt;On Giving to the Poor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You taught me by your words and actions that we shouldn’t give money to poor and/or homeless people, because they would probably spend it on drugs or a cell phone instead of something they &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; need. It might make us look bad if someone thought we were “enabling” poor people. Besides, if they would just get a job, they wouldn’t be homeless anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus, on the other hand, tended to advocate giving freely to those in need, not making judgment calls about whether they truly needed assistance. He also said this crazy thing about not letting your right hand know what your left hand was doing when you give to the poor, because we should be giving from a spirit of love for others, not because we want to look good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-race&quot;&gt;On Race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You taught me that I need to be afraid of black men by making sure I knew to always lock the car doors when driving through their neighborhoods – the “bad” neighborhoods. You consistently reinforced the idea in my mind that black people – even those who had “good” jobs, families, and no criminal records – were more likely to become a criminal or a druggie because of their skin color. You called them thugs and claimed that they needed to “get over” slavery and other injustices done to them (because that was “in the past”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus, on the other hand, spent the majority of his time with the people who society considered criminals or outcasts. He listened to their plight and, instead of telling them to get over it, took action to address their needs – physically, emotionally, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; spiritually. He never gave in to fear of the other, and he certainly never became angry with those who felt oppressed. He modeled a kind of love that takes seriously the feelings of others, even those who most of society would have deemed “too sensitive” or “overly offended.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-on-money&quot;&gt;More on Money&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You taught me that anyone who utilized government assistance programs was a lazy mooch, because all it takes to get out of their situation is a better work ethic. You ranted about how you hated that your tax dollars helped pay for their food, and it especially enraged you that they had the audacity to purchase junk food OR steak, because one is too unhealthy and the other too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus, on the other hand… well, first see above about giving freely. Also consider that Jesus explicitly taught that we should not hold tightly to worldly possessions (such as those “hard earned tax dollars” of yours). I believe that Jesus would have been in favor of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; program, government or otherwise, that used money for such a positive thing as putting food in the bellies of those who might otherwise go hungry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-immigrants-and-refugees&quot;&gt;On Immigrants and Refugees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You taught me that Islam was the enemy of Christianity – that a Muslim’s goal in life is to eradicate us, and I should fear them. Because of this, you claimed that we should keep every Muslim out of our country, no matter how badly they needed a new home (usually since we bombed and disrupted the power structures in their old home). You also taught me that if we let them in, they would take over our communities and try to institute Sharia law in our country, usually through the form of terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You taught me that immigrants of any kind hurt us because they want to take our jobs. You also taught me that our economic security was more important than allowing immigrants to secure a better, safer life for themselves and their families. You taught me that I should care more about my immediate family than I care about others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus, on the other hand, taught that we are not to worry about tomorrow. Fear, not hate, is the opposite of love, and we are to live in love. I believe that Jesus would be disappointed in the amount of fear you hold and spread about those created in his image. Just as he embraced people from all walks of life, so would he encourage us to embrace Muslims despite our differences. On top of that, Jesus always placed the needs of others before his own. If we are to truly model that, accepting and supporting immigrants and refugees should be at the top of our lists no matter how many jobs we might lose in the process or how much fear we must fight off. Personal wealth or safety is of little value to a Christian if, to achieve it, they must forfeit their love. What good is it to gain the world and lose your soul?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-guns-and-killing-people&quot;&gt;On Guns and Killing People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You taught me how to shoot a gun, and told me that if anyone ever breaks into our house, I should shoot to kill, not simply wound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus, on the other hand, modeled the most extreme form of giving your own life at the hands of those seeking to hurt you. Can you honestly imagine Jesus giving the okay to kill someone? I can’t, even in the most extreme of circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I’m still amazed by the things I accepted as “Christian” for the first 22 years of my life, but I know that I can’t be satisfied with this list. I know there are more ideas, hidden deep inside my brain, that I have yet to identify. I have a feeling it will never truly be over, because indoctrination runs deep. But I am thankful that I have learned how to more deeply experience Jesus and his &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; unconditional love.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="christianity" /><category term="family" /><summary type="html">My entire life has been based around Christian values.

&lt;p&gt;I was recently married and along with that, recently freed to share my rapidly changing opinions. I was no longer held back by the idea that you might not pay for my schooling or the wedding, so I started sharing “controversial” things on my Facebook page. Refugees have obviously been a hot topic the last few years, and for some reason most of the Christians I grew up around were (and still are) adamantly against taking them in - especially ones from majority Muslim countries. (I know, I know, Sharia law and terrorists and such mean we don’t need to love them. You don’t need to explain yourself to me. *eye roll*)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following tweet from Donald Trump, Jr., was making the rounds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/trumpjrskittles.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot of Trump, Jr.'s skittles tweet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, I shared the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/eattheskittles.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot of &amp;quot;eat the skittles&amp;quot; post&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post caused quite a bit of drama as well as some good, productive conversation. What sticks out to me the most when I think back to it, however, is not the fact that some of my family and friends are seemingly heartless when dealing with Muslims in particular. It’s the response that my father posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father, who spent a lot of time and money sending me to a private Christian academy, taking me to church, making sure I went to youth group, and paying for me to attend a Baptist college. It’s obvious which values he wanted to instill in me, and I would say that by all possible measures, he succeeded. The problem we’ve now run into is that I seem to have bought into a more radical living out of those values than he ever intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Your suggestion with this piece sounds good in theory, and is biblically a good response. But in real life, I guarantee you would think twice and maybe never eat the skittles. Your overt denunciation for the preservation of our ability to even remain the country God has given to us is starting to wear on me. Simply because we want to preserve our God given rights in this country does not mean we have no compassion what so ever for those in need. Your idealistic thoughts are noble, but naive to the world as it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you catch that? Let me make it more obvious, without all the stuff in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Your suggestion with this piece sounds good in theory, and is biblically a good response. But in real life… Your idealistic thoughts are noble, but naive to the world as it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what you’re telling me, dad, is that I have presented a biblically good response that you deem idealistic, naive, and therefore unrealistic to actually live out? Do you hear yourself? Everything you’ve ever presented to me as the truth is centered around the Bible, and now you’re telling me that I got it correct biblically but not “realistically?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My opinions have surely been drifting further and further from yours, but not because I’m leaving the things you taught me behind. I’ve been walking away from your brand of Christianity because I see such a disconnect between the things you told me were true and the things you seem to believe. I’ll cover more of them in future posts, but this particular instance represents the first time the full weight of this discrepancy hit me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You made it blatantly obvious in your comment that you are willing to disregard biblical truths for your own comfort and personal safety. You also apparently place more value on your American rights than you do on biblical truths that might warrant forsaking those rights (but that’s a topic that deserves its own post, as I have since discovered many other areas of your life that such a view affects).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, though, it wasn’t what you said as much as what it represented. Up to the point that this interaction occurred, I still believed that you were just misguided in a few areas, but that you still believed the things you had taught me. I no longer think that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see now that your religion actually has very little to do with following Jesus and much more to do with serving your selfish American ideals. I don’t know where along the line you lost Jesus, or if you never truly wanted to follow him in the first place, but you also lost me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You lost my respect that day, because you didn’t even attempt to use the Bible to back your beliefs. At least people who use the Bible to back up their lack of love can semi-convincingly state that they’re still following the Bible. At least then we can debate biblical interpretation and practical application. You didn’t even try. You just outright ignored the Bible, cast it to the side, instead choosing to follow your nationalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your opinions about my faith and how it should inform my politics no longer matter to me, because you have demonstrated that they are not informed by the love of Jesus but by your love of self and country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite the disappointment I felt upon having this realization, I will continue to love radically, just like you taught me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="christianity" /><category term="family" /><summary type="html">On September 22, 2016, almost exactly a year ago, any weight your opinions may have held in my life vanished.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">On Being a Woman</title><link href="http://carissanicolewinn.github.io/On-Being-a-Woman/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On Being a Woman" /><published>2017-09-12T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-09-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://carissanicolewinn.github.io/On-Being-a-Woman</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://carissanicolewinn.github.io/On-Being-a-Woman/">&lt;p&gt;I do a lot of reading, specifically blogs, news articles, editorials, etc. Most of what I read I get from my Facebook feed. I was scrolling a few days ago and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gretchen-kelly/the-thing-all-women-do-you-dont-know-about_b_8630416.html?ncid=engmodushpmg00000003&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; caught my eye. I couldn’t get it to load on my phone at the moment, so I moved on and forgot about it (much like the instances discussed in the article itself, ironically).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, it popped up again, this time shared by a friend with her own personal stories of male harrassment and living in a patriarchal, sexist culture attached to it. I was inspired, probably impulsively, to write up a small collection of my own stories. There are plenty more that I could tell, but these are the few that stuck out to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;true-stories-from-my-own-life&quot;&gt;True stories from my own life:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was on a work trip, unloading boxes from the truck by the street, &amp;amp; Jared was inside the building &amp;amp; not around, &amp;amp; 2 men were walking by on the sidewalk. One of them very loudly says “HEY BEAUTIFUL,” but I ignore it. Don’t make eye contact. Keep unloading boxes. A few seconds later, when it’s clear I’m not going to interact with his catcalling, he says, very loudly again, “WHAT A BITCH!” &amp;amp; suddenly I’m afraid that he might walk over to me, &amp;amp; I’m all alone, praying that Jared comes back soon. Thankfully, he keeps walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I’m fresh out of high school working at Bob Evans as a waitress the summer before college. The customer base is significantly made up of the elderly, but that doesn’t stop old men from grabbing my hands, telling me that I have a nice “figure,” &amp;amp; leaving me one or two quarters as a tip if I don’t smile, laugh, &amp;amp; flirt back. So I quickly learn that to make money at this job, I have to flirt with the men I serve. Like the table of 4 college aged guys that I had to serve once. Everything they asked for was a sexual innuendo, with their eyes following my chest or my butt as I would walk away to get it for them. I giggled &amp;amp; did my best to play it up, knowing that I’d get a nice tip if I did. &amp;amp; I was right, they left me almost a 75% tip on their meal. My manager (also a man) saw my big tip &amp;amp; promptly walked over to me, bent down, &amp;amp; brushed off my knees as if there was dirt on them. The implication being that I was on my knees giving them sexual favors for such a big tip. The whole kitchen laughed, except for one other waitress who made eye contact with me as I blushed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was still working at that restaurant 2 summers later, &amp;amp; I’m the closing shift. The manager on duty has to walk me to my car, because a man has been hanging around the building trying to talk to the servers as they leave. By the time I’m leaving, it’s dark out, &amp;amp; I have to park by the dumpster where there’s no lamp light because you always save the best parking spots for customers. But once, my manager doesn’t walk me out, &amp;amp; I clutch my keys between my fingers, goosebumps on my arms even though it’s summertime. Thankfully, the creep wasn’t around that night, but who knows what would have happened if he had been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was working at Sears one summer, &amp;amp; a coworker kept getting too close to me physically &amp;amp; trying to flirt with me. My manager informed me that “he’s just like that” so I shouldn’t “let it bother me.” He was uncomfortably close one too many times, &amp;amp; I actually asked him to stop (not told, asked. I wasn’t even mean). He then got angry with me, &amp;amp; since I was the new employee, he successfully convinced a large portion of my coworkers that I was a stuck up bitch. It took me weeks (over 3/4 of the summer) to find more than 1 person who would willingly eat lunch with me because of it, although I did successfully re-convince most of them that I was a nice person by the end of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;minimizing-suppressing-ignoring-denying&quot;&gt;Minimizing, Suppressing, Ignoring, Denying&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gretchen-kelly/the-thing-all-women-do-you-dont-know-about_b_8630416.html?ncid=engmodushpmg00000003&quot;&gt;The Thing All Women Do That You Don’t Know About&lt;/a&gt; does a great job of describing the small incidents that quickly add up in daily life. The glances at our chests, the demeaning nicknames, the way men will stand just slightly too close. Pieces of the bigger picture, one that is hard to recognize even as a woman who lives it. Looking back on most of my stories, I didn’t know that those instances were anything other than normal. I grew up in a culture that taught me to ignore “those” type of men, because their actions were expected. But now, I know that my body is not something to which men are entitled. I know that my time, my feelings, and my affection are not something I must give to anyone who demands it. I know that it is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; normal to constantly put my guard up when interacting with men, whether at work or just walking down the street. But I also know that it is difficult to recognize when you are so entrenched in the system, and almost impossible if you are outside of it. I must learn to stop minimizing, suppressing, ignoring, and/or denying these so-called “small” instances and instead, start exposing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll leave you with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/TheAmyCourts/posts/10155136279258353?pnref=story&quot;&gt;these words&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This line we women dance - of defending ourselves and our right to exist, protecting ourselves from men who feel entitled to our bodies and our conversation, while avoiding angering them and endangering ourselves further - is a daily thing. We can’t go to the store, go for a walk, or go to work without encountering this kind of behavior on the regular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is exhausting. 
It’s dehumanizing. 
It’s being a woman.&lt;/p&gt;
