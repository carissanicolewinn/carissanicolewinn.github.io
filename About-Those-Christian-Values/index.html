    <p>My entire life has been based around Christian values. Well, that’s not entirely true. My entire life has been based around white American conservative Christian values, with much more emphasis on the “white American conservative” part than the “Christian” part.</p>

<p>These are a few of the lessons you taught me through your words and actions – and they directly contradict what Jesus lived and taught.</p>

<h2 id="on-giving-to-the-poor">On Giving to the Poor</h2>

<p>You taught me by your words and actions that we shouldn’t give money to poor and/or homeless people, because they would probably spend it on drugs or a cell phone instead of something they <em>actually</em> need. It might make us look bad if someone thought we were “enabling” poor people. Besides, if they would just get a job, they wouldn’t be homeless anymore.</p>

<p>Jesus, on the other hand, tended to advocate giving freely to those in need, not making judgment calls about whether they truly needed assistance. He also said this crazy thing about not letting your right hand know what your left hand was doing when you give to the poor, because we should be giving from a spirit of love for others, not because we want to look good.</p>

<h2 id="on-race">On Race</h2>

<p>You taught me that I need to be afraid of black men by making sure I knew to always lock the car doors when driving through their neighborhoods – the “bad” neighborhoods. You consistently reinforced the idea in my mind that black people – even those who had “good” jobs, families, and no criminal records – were more likely to become a criminal or a druggie because of their skin color. You called them thugs and claimed that they needed to “get over” slavery and other injustices done to them (because that was “in the past”).</p>

<p>Jesus, on the other hand, spent the majority of his time with the people who society considered criminals or outcasts. He listened to their plight and, instead of telling them to get over it, took action to address their needs – physically, emotionally, <em>and</em> spiritually. He never gave in to fear of the other, and he certainly never became angry with those who felt oppressed. He modeled a kind of love that takes seriously the feelings of others, even those who most of society would have deemed “too sensitive” or “overly offended.”</p>

<h2 id="more-on-money">More on Money</h2>

<p>You taught me that anyone who utilized government assistance programs was a lazy mooch, because all it takes to get out of their situation is a better work ethic. You ranted about how you hated that your tax dollars helped pay for their food, and it especially enraged you that they had the audacity to purchase junk food OR steak, because one is too unhealthy and the other too expensive.</p>

<p>Jesus, on the other hand… well, first see above about giving freely. Also consider that Jesus explicitly taught that we should not hold tightly to worldly possessions (such as those “hard earned tax dollars” of yours). I believe that Jesus would have been in favor of <em>any</em> program, government or otherwise, that used money for such a positive thing as putting food in the bellies of those who might otherwise go hungry.</p>

<h2 id="on-immigrants-and-refugees">On Immigrants and Refugees</h2>

<p>You taught me that Islam was the enemy of Christianity – that a Muslim’s goal in life is to eradicate us, and I should fear them. Because of this, you claimed that we should keep every Muslim out of our country, no matter how badly they needed a new home (usually since we bombed and disrupted the power structures in their old home). You also taught me that if we let them in, they would take over our communities and try to institute Sharia law in our country, usually through the form of terrorism.</p>

<p>You taught me that immigrants of any kind hurt us because they want to take our jobs. You also taught me that our economic security was more important than allowing immigrants to secure a better, safer life for themselves and their families. You taught me that I should care more about my immediate family than I care about others.</p>

<p>Jesus, on the other hand, taught that we are not to worry about tomorrow. Fear, not hate, is the opposite of love, and we are to live in love. I believe that Jesus would be disappointed in the amount of fear you hold and spread about those created in his image. Just as he embraced people from all walks of life, so would he encourage us to embrace Muslims despite our differences. On top of that, Jesus always placed the needs of others before his own. If we are to truly model that, accepting and supporting immigrants and refugees should be at the top of our lists no matter how many jobs we might lose in the process or how much fear we must fight off. Personal wealth or safety is of little value to a Christian if, to achieve it, they must forfeit their love. What good is it to gain the world and lose your soul?</p>

<h2 id="on-guns-and-killing-people">On Guns and Killing People</h2>

<p>You taught me how to shoot a gun, and told me that if anyone ever breaks into our house, I should shoot to kill, not simply wound.</p>

<p>Jesus, on the other hand, modeled the most extreme form of giving your own life at the hands of those seeking to hurt you. Can you honestly imagine Jesus giving the okay to kill someone? I can’t, even in the most extreme of circumstances.</p>

<hr />

<p>Sometimes I’m still amazed by the things I accepted as “Christian” for the first 22 years of my life, but I know that I can’t be satisfied with this list. I know there are more ideas, hidden deep inside my brain, that I have yet to identify. I have a feeling it will never truly be over, because indoctrination runs deep. But I am thankful that I have learned how to more deeply experience Jesus and his <em>truly</em> unconditional love.</p>
